/**
 * @todo: a set to "tidy" an expression. Different from a canonical form, but
 * inline with the user's expectations.

 * Example:
 *
 * - a^n * a^m -> a^(n+m)
 * - a / √b -> (a * √b) / b

/**
 * A set of simplification rules.
 *
 * The rules are expressed as
 *
 *    `[lhs, rhs, condition]`
 *
 * where `lhs` is rewritten as `rhs` if `condition` is true.
 *
 * `lhs` and `rhs` can be either an Expression or a LaTeX string.
 *
 * If using an Expression, the expression is *not* canonicalized before being
 * used. Therefore in some cases using Expression, while more verbose,
 * may be necessary as the expression could be simplified by the canonicalization.
